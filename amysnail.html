		<h3>Description Of Owner:</h3>
			<p>Amy Van is the owner of Amy’s Nail. She opened the nail salon because she had an interest in doing nails back in Vietnam. When she moved to America, she opened her own store. Her husband, Peter Van was
			an engineer, but because of his work he needed to travel a lot. Therefore he was rarely at home. Amy disapproved of it because she wanted him to be with him and their kids. Peter decided to quit his job to
			be with his family more and is now working and helping around the store for his wife. Now they both co-own Amy’s Nail. </p>
